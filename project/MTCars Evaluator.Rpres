Overview of MTCars Evaluator
========================================================

The MTCars Evlautor has a left panel with sliders for selecting ranges for the QSEC and HP variables.  A boxplot on in the right panel will refresh to show gas mileage of car models in that range. 

```{r}
boxplot(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars, main="Car Milage Data", 
xlab="Number of Cylinders", ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
```

List of Cars 
========================================================
In addition, a list of cars will appear below the boxplot that fit within the values from the sliders.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(mtcars))
```
