How to Use the MTCars Evaluator
========================================================

Adjust the sliders on the left panel to select the QSEC and HP variables of cars to be evaluated.  As the sliders are adjusted, a boxplot on in the right panel will refresh to show gas mileage of car models in that range. 

```{r fig.align='center', size=8, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars, main="Car Milage Data", 
xlab="Number of Cylinders", ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
```

List of Cars 
========================================================
In addition, a list of cars will appear below the boxplot that fit within the values from the sliders.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(head(mtcars))
```
